<p>The markersize will be scaled with the earthquake magnitude. To do so, we add a <code class="docutils literal notranslate"><span class="pre">marker_size</span></code> series in the DataFrame</p>

<h2>Mapping using Plotly<a class="headerlink" href="#mapping-using-plotly" title="Permalink to this headline">#</a></h2>
<p>Now we will plot the earthquakes locations on a map using the Plotly package. More tutorials on <a class="reference external" href="https://plotly.com/">Plotly</a>. Input of the function in the function is self-explanatory and typical of Python’s function. The code <a class="reference external" href="https://plotly.com/python/scatter-plots-on-maps/">documentation</a> of Plotly scatter_geo lists the variables.</p>

</div>
<p>We can access to a brief summary of the data:</p>
<div class="cell docutils container">
<div class="cell_input docutils container">
<div class="highlight-ipython3 notranslate"><div class="highlight"><pre><span></span><span class="n">data</span><span class="o">.</span><span class="n">station</span><span class="o">.</span><span class="n">describe</span><span class="p">()</span>

</pre></div>
</div>
</div>
</div>
<p>We can perform standard operations on the whole data set:</p>
<div class="cell docutils container">
<div class="cell_input docutils container">
<div class="highlight-ipython3 notranslate"><div class="highlight"><pre><span></span><span class="n">data</span><span class="o">.</span><span class="n">mean</span><span class="p">()</span>
</pre></div>
</div>
</div>
</div>
<p>In the case of a categorical variable, we can get the list of possile values that this variable can take:</p>
<div class="cell docutils container">
<div class="cell_input docutils container">
<div class="highlight-ipython3 notranslate"><div class="highlight"><pre><span></span><span class="n">data</span><span class="o">.</span><span class="n">channel</span><span class="o">.</span><span class="n">unique</span><span class="p">()</span>
</pre></div>
</div>
</div>
</div>
<p>and get the number of times that each value is taken:</p>
<div class="cell docutils container">
<div class="cell_input docutils container">
<div class="highlight-ipython3 notranslate"><div class="highlight"><pre><span></span><span class="n">data</span><span class="o">.</span><span class="n">station</span><span class="o">.</span><span class="n">value_counts</span><span class="p">()</span>
</pre></div>
</div>
</div>
</div>
<p>The second option is to use the apply function:</p>
<div class="cell docutils container">
<div class="cell_input docutils container">
<div class="highlight-ipython3 notranslate"><div class="highlight"><pre><span></span><span class="n">data_elevation_mean</span><span class="o">=</span><span class="n">data</span><span class="o">.</span><span class="n">elevation</span><span class="o">.</span><span class="n">unique</span><span class="p">()</span><span class="o">.</span><span class="n">mean</span><span class="p">()</span>

</pre></div>
</div>
</div>
</div>
<p>We can also carry out simple operations on columns, provided they make sense.</p>
<div class="cell docutils container">
<div class="cell_input docutils container">
<div class="highlight-ipython3 notranslate"><div class="highlight"><pre><span></span><span class="n">data</span><span class="o">.</span><span class="n">network</span> <span class="o">+</span> <span class="s1">&#39; - &#39;</span> <span class="o">+</span> <span class="n">data</span><span class="o">.</span><span class="n">station</span>
</pre></div>
</div>
</div>
</div>
<p>A useful feature is to group the rows depending on the value of a categorical variable, and then apply the same operation to all the groups. For instance, I want to know how many times each station appears in the file:</p>
<div class="cell docutils container">
<div class="cell_input docutils container">
<div class="highlight-ipython3 notranslate"><div class="highlight"><pre><span></span><span class="n">data</span><span class="o">.</span><span class="n">groupby</span><span class="p">(</span><span class="s1">&#39;station&#39;</span><span class="p">)</span><span class="o">.</span><span class="n">station</span><span class="o">.</span><span class="n">count</span><span class="p">()</span>
</pre></div>
</div>
</div>
</div>
<p>We can have access to the data type of each column:</p>
<div class="cell docutils container">
<div class="cell_input docutils container">
<div class="highlight-ipython3 notranslate"><div class="highlight"><pre><span></span><span class="n">data</span><span class="o">.</span><span class="n">dtypes</span>
</pre></div>
</div>
</div>
</div>
<p>Here, pandas does not recognize the start_time and end_time columns as a datetime format, so we cannot use datetime operations on them. We first need to convert these columns into a datetime format:</p>

<p>When we select only some rows, the index is not automatically reset to start at 0. We can do it manually. Many functions in pandas have also an option to reset the index, and option to transform the dataframe in place, instead of saving the results in another variable.</p>

<p>Parquet is a compressed data format that stores and compress the culumns. It is fast for I/O and compact format.</p>
<p>Save <code class="docutils literal notranslate"><span class="pre">data</span></code> into a CSV file:</p>
