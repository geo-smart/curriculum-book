# 2.1 Data Modalities

Geoscientific data is particularly diverse: point measurements of soil moisture, high rate time series (1000 samples per second) seismograms, rasterized LandSAT imagery, Geospatial and Temporal simulated geophysical fields.

The difference in dimensionalities among geoscientific data challenges the design of machine learning models across disciplines. For most machine-learning practictioner, data modalities are classified as **dimension**. One example is a geophysical model that uses sattelite imagery (2D in space) with time series (1D in time) from point-based sensor measurements to predict an output.

Machine Learning can handle multi-modal analysis. It borrows technique from Data Fusion.
